# AI Module â€” SmartCare Health

## Overview
The AI Module provides early-screening and decision-support tools to assist community health workers and caregivers in identifying common childhood and maternal health risks (e.g., malnutrition, respiratory infections, developmental delays). This module is part of the open-source SmartCare Health platform.

## Objectives
- Support early detection of conditions through symptom and image analysis.  
- Provide actionable risk flags and recommended next steps for clinicians.  
- Personalise preventive reminders for families using ML-driven insights.

## Data sources
- De-identified community health records, growth charts, and symptom checklists collected during pilots.  
- Public health datasets where available and ethically sourced.  
- Consent-driven photo / image samples for supervised training (if applicable).

## Model architecture (prototype)
- Lightweight convolutional model for basic image screening (mobile-friendly).  
- Small gradient-boosted or neural classifier for symptom + vitals input.  
- Local inference on device or edge server; optional cloud model for heavier processing.

## Evaluation & metrics
- Sensitivity / specificity for target conditions.  
- Precision, recall, and F1 for classification tasks.  
- Usability metrics: time-to-result, clinician acceptance, and false-positive rate.

## Ethical & privacy considerations
- All data will be de-identified before use.  
- Models will be trained and evaluated for bias; fairness checks will be documented.  
- Patient data access controlled via blockchain-based consent and access logs.

## Usage
- Exposes a minimal API for integration with the mobile app and telemedicine module.  
- Documentation and pretrained weights (if safe to share) will be published in the repo.

Released under the MIT License (or other UNICEF-approved open-source license).
