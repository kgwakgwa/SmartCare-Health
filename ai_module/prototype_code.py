SmartCare Health — AI Prototype Module
--------------------------------------

This prototype demonstrates the early design of SmartCare’s
AI-driven health screening system for maternal and child care.

It performs basic risk flagging using simplified symptom data.
Future versions will integrate image analysis and ML models
to assist healthcare workers with early diagnosis support.
