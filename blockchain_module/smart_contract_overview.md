# Blockchain Module â€” SmartCare Health

## Overview
The Blockchain Module ensures **secure, transparent, and privacy-respecting management of patient health data** within the SmartCare platform.  
It leverages blockchain technology to record consent, verify data integrity, and enable interoperability between clinics.

## Objectives
- Create tamper-proof health records linked to unique patient IDs.  
- Provide a verifiable audit trail of all data access and updates.  
- Support user-controlled data sharing and consent management.  
- Improve coordination across clinics without compromising patient privacy.

## Prototype Design
- **Layer:** Ethereum-compatible private network (subject to evaluation).  
- **Smart Contract Functions:**  
  - Register patient record hashes.  
  - Manage access control via consent tokens.  
  - Log interactions for transparency and accountability.  

## Data Security
- Only **metadata or hashes** are stored on-chain.  
- Actual health data remains encrypted off-chain.  
- All transactions are digitally signed by authorized parties.

## Ethical Principles
- Informed consent is mandatory for data use.  
- Patients can revoke data access at any time.  
- The blockchain layer supports GDPR- and POPIA-aligned practices.

## Integration
The blockchain module integrates with the AI and mobile app modules to synchronize verified patient information and maintain consistent records across the SmartCare ecosystem.
